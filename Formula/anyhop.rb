# Homebrew formula for the headless `anyhop` channel (macOS + Linux).
#
# This is the canonical source of the formula. The `homebrew-tap` tap ships a
# copy of it; the release workflow updates the tap's copy only after the
# matching `anyhop` release exists on PyPI, using
# `scripts/update-homebrew-formula.py` to fill the `url`/`sha256` below with the
# digest PyPI recorded for the published sdist. The resource pins are taken from
# uv.lock (tests/test_homebrew_formula.py keeps them from drifting).
#
# Product boundary: this channel is deliberately headless. It installs the CLI,
# background daemon, loopback control API, and the version-locked bundled Web UI
# — no GUI surface of any kind. The base wheel enforces that boundary for every
# native distribution channel.

      This is the headless anyhop channel: CLI, background daemon, loopback
      control API, and the bundled Web UI.

      Manage the background daemon with brew services rather than
      `anyhop daemon install` (which would register a competing launchd/systemd
      unit for the same user):

        brew services start anyhop      # start now and at login
        brew services stop anyhop

      State lives in ~/.anyhop. Open the Web UI with `anyhop ui`.
